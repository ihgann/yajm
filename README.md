## Background

This project was created mostly as a learning experience, though it has proven
useful in some side projects. The primary driver was to introduce an
easy-to-use Java Mapper that could infer objects via field names and provide
easy-to-write customizable mappings where inference wouldn't work.

## Install

```
mvn clean install
```
